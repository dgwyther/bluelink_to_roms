In the case of long simulations, it appeared more practical
to run month by month simulations. The csh script :
$\sim$/Roms\_tools/Run/run\_roms.csh is restarting automatically
roms each simulated month (or year). To analyze these long simulations,
a few scripts have been added in the directory: 
$\sim$/Roms\_tools/Diagnostic\_tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item roms\_anim.m  : Create an animation from the monthly  history or average files.
\item get\_Mmean.m  : Get the mean for each month.
\item get\_Smean.m  : Get the seasonal and annual mean.
\item get\_Meddy.m  : Get the variance for each month.
\item get\_Meddy\_ns.m  : Get the non-seasonal (i.e., the seasonal variation are 
filtered) variance for each month.
\item get\_Seddy.m  : Get the seasonal and annual variance.
\item get\_Seddy\_ns.m  : Get the seasonal and annual non-seasonal variance.
\end{itemize}
The mean or variance files can be visualized by roms\_gui.
